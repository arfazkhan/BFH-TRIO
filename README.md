# TRIO
  TRIO is an upcoming shopping application in which virtual shopping is redefined. It is just a simple fashion shopping app developed with flutter. The main focus of this project was to make a simple and minimal UI and enrich the application with a seamless shopping experience. The app has got the options to navigate through different categories, filter out preferences, add a product in favourites, view cart, checkout and more. This app boasts of an upcoming feature of getting trials up to 5 items before payment. Currently, TRIO is still under development and the uploaded code is just a working prototype that is yet to be completely functional. Stay tuned for the upcoming updates :)

Why TRIO?
As physical shopping comes with certain limitaions today, due to the pandemic and it limits the customer from stepping outside their house. Moreover, in todays virtual era, people tend to opt for virtuasl shopping. Hence, TRIO.

So when we initially began with this project, we were basically newbies to almost everything be it the design, product development and so on. Tinker Hub- Build From Home gave us the opportunity to explore certain areas within a stipulated time period of 10 days. Those 10 days were actually fun and enabled and inspired us to learn something new.
During the first phase of the project we researched about the needs, the requirements and pretty much everything. Then we spened more time designing and making a perfecting UI using Adobe XD. We did not stop there, we further continued with the development of a prototype version and succeded marginally. Given the time constraint, we released the prototype and are expecting the feedback from real users like you and with your feedback we would be improving and developing the app further.

## How TRIO Works?
  TRIO shopping app was solely focused on UI during its initial stages. Therefore, only a little preference was given to UX. TRIO has got different pages for each function, each functions redirects to its respective pages. The basic hierarchy of the project:\
  -Splash Screen\
  -Intro\
  -Signup/Signin\
  -Home\
  -Categories\
  -Specific Category\
  -Product Description\
  -Favourites\
  -Cart\
  -Payment\
  Another distinctive remark of TRIO is that most of the development was done using the "adobe_xd" plugin. This approach was intended for educational and testing purposes. As of now the app is still under development, we will be adding more features and making it completely functional using firebase and other plugins.

## Libraries used
  To develop TRIO folowing libraries were used exclusively throughout the project:\
    adobe_xd: ^2.0.0+1\
    flutter_svg: ^0.21.0+1\
    async: ^2.6.1
    
## How to configure
  Setting up and configuring this project is pretty easy. Just clone this repository update the plugins and you are good to go. As this project does not use firebase at the moment, you can neglect setting up your firebase server.
